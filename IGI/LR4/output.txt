In an overgrown park
There is an old house.
The windows are clogged,
And darkness reigns eternally in it.
I tried to say:::____________;;;;;;----------(
There are no monsters on earth.:::(((
But then it rang out ;)
A terrible voice in the darkness.
Voice in the darkness...
It hurts me to see white light,:0
I feel better in complete darkness.
I have been for many, many years
I only dream about food.
It's too cramped for me to be locked up
And I dream of one thing -
Find freedom soon
Gnawing through your dilapidated old house.:-]
Damn old house!..
There was a grandfather and he died.
Blind and terribly evil.
Nobody remembered
About him since that cold winter.
The neighbors didn't
Then bury him.
We just got the boards,
We decided to hammer
Door and windows...
It hurts me to see the white light
I feel better in complete darkness.
I have been for many, many years
I only dream about food.
It's too cramped for me to be locked up
And I dream of one thing -
Find freedom soon
Gnawing through your dilapidated old house.
Damn old house!..
And this place is by the way
The village people are walking around.
And the superstitious say:
Ghosts live there.
